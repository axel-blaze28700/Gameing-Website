<h2>Other additions and changes</h2>
<p>Other new features and changes from previous Grand Theft Auto games include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Gang wars:</b> Battles with enemy gangs are prompted whenever the player ventures into enemy territory and kills at least three gang members. If the player then survives three waves of enemies, the territory will be won, and fellow gang members will begin wandering the streets of these areas. The more territory owned by the player, the more money that will be generated. Occasionally, the player's territory will come under attack from enemy gangs and defeating them will be necessary to retain these areas. Once all marked territories are claimed for the protagonist's gang from one of the two hostile gangs, the opposing gang can no longer attack. Once the player takes control of all territories from both rival gangs, none can come under attack.</p></li>
<li><p>Car modification: Most automobiles in the game can be modified and upgraded at various garages. All car mods are strictly visual apart from the stereo system and nitrous oxide upgrade, which increases bass and gives the car a speed boost when activated, respectively; and hydraulics, which lowers the car's height by default and allows the player to control various aspects of the car's suspension. Other common modifications include paint jobs, rims, body kits, side skirts, bumpers, and spoilers.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Burglary:</b>Continuing the series' tradition of controversy, home invasion is included as a potential money-making activity.By stealing a burglary van, CJ can sneak into a residence at night and cart off valuables or shake down the occupants.</p></li>
