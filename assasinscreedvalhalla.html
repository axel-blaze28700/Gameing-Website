<td><p>In AD 873, war and overcrowding in Norway prompts Eivor and their adoptive older brother Sigurd to lead their clan of Vikings to settle new lands in Anglo-Saxon England, as part of the Viking expansion across Europe. The clan comes into conflict with the kingdoms of Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia over the next several years, as well as the warring sons of the legendary Viking warrior Ragnar Lothbrok, who made up the Great Heathen Army.Eivor's clan will face forces led by the leaders of these kingdoms, including Alfred the Great, the king of Wessex. It is during this time that Eivor meets the Hidden Ones and joins their fight against the Order of the Ancients. Explorable cities include Winchester, London, and York. Parts of Norway and Vinland are also included.</p></td>

<p>As a young child, Eivor witnessed the death of their parents at the hands of the rogue Viking warlord Kjotve the Cruel before being rescued by Sigurd, the son of the local king. Eighteen years later, an adult Eivor continues their pursuit of Kjotve to take revenge. While their latest attempt fails, Eivor is at least able to recover their father's axe. Upon touching the axe, Eivor experiences a vivid vision of Odin. Curious about the vision, Eivor consults the local seer Valka. Valka induces another vision in Eivor that shows Sigurd, now Eivor's adoptive sibling, missing an arm before a giant wolf attacks both of them. Valka interprets the vision as a prophecy that Eivor will eventually betray Sigurd, which Eivor remains sceptical of. King Styrbjorn of the Raven Clan, Eivor's adoptive father, chastises Eivor for continuing the hunt for Kjotve, which risks open war their clan has no chance of winning alone. Sigurd then returns from a two year raiding expedition, bringing riches and a pair of mysterious foreigners, Basim and Hytham of the Hidden Ones.</p>
