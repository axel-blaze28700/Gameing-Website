<h1>What's a Terms and Conditions Agreement?</h1>
<p>Because Infinity Gaming Forms can be used to collect personal information online, it carries certain privacy concerns and security risks. For example, names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and personal preferences can be collected with Infinity Gaming Forms.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may have rules and requirements in place for the proper use of Google Forms to help protect your business or the information you are collecting.</p>
<p>Depending on which features you use in Infinity Gaming Forms, you'll collect different types of data. If your form is for a business, a Terms and Conditions agreement can help establish your right to modify your forms and store the collected data.</p>
<p>A Terms and Conditions agreement is a set of rules a user must agree to if he wants to use a website or an application, including completing an online form such as a Infinity Gaming Form.</p>
<p>Terms & Conditions can be used to address anything that affects your website. Some common points to cover may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payment terms for services requiring a subscription</li>
<li>Abuses of the website and illegal activities that can lead to termination of accounts</li>
<li>Guidelines for any user generated content or online community</li>
<li>Trademark and copyright protection of your content and content uploaded to your website or app</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike a Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions agreements are not mandated by law. However, creating a custom Terms and Conditions for your website and any online forms you use is highly recommended as a business best practice.</p>
<p>If you don't have a Terms and Conditions for your website, app or online forms, you are leaving yourself open to potential liability or misuse of your site.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of reasons why you a need Terms and Conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent abuse from users - Your Terms and Conditions can give you the authority to ban or suspend users for any reasons you deem necessary.</li>
<li>Protect your content - Your Terms and Conditions can protect your intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>Limit your liability - Your Terms and Conditions can inform users of your limited liability. This helps prevent frivolous lawsuits.</li>
<li>Provide notice of governing law - Your Terms and Conditions should include a statement establishing the jurisdiction of your terms, and where any legal dispute will be handled.</li>
</ul>
